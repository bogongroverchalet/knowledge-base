## Mountain Bike Weekend

The trip will be an action packed experience, allowing Venturers to enjoy the
thrills and spills of Mountain Bike Riding in some of the most highly regarded
off road cycling areas in Australia.

If you are pursuing your Queen’s Scout it also offers a chance for Venturers to
achieve their Outdoor 1 in Mountain Bike Riding. We will offer badge advisers,
quality instruction and at least 15 hours of riding, which will include all
aspects of Mountain Bike Riding including Down Hill, Cross Country, Obstacle
Crossings, Bike Maintenance and Safety.

ride in the scenic Victorian high country this weekend is for YOU. Venturer
Leaders are encouraged to accompany their Venturers.
